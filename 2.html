<p>Cascading is a software abstraction layer for Apache Hadoop and Apache Flink.
    Cascading is used to create and execute complex data processing workflows on a Hadoop cluster using any JVM-based language (Java, JRuby, Clojure, etc.), hiding the underlying complexity of MapReduce jobs. It is open source and available under the Apache License.
    Commercial support is available from Driven, Inc.[1]
Cascading was originally authored by Chris Wensel, who later founded Concurrent, Inc, which has been re-branded as Driven.[2] Cascading is being actively developed by the community[citation needed] and a number of add-on modules are available.[3]
